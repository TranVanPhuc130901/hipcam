                            Hipcamp is a growing community of good-natured people and the most comprehensive resource
                            for unique outdoor stays. We work with landowners to offer tent camping, RV parks, cabins,
                            treehouses, and glamping—everywhere from national parks to blueberry farms. By creating
                            opportunities for landowners to earn money hosting nature lovers, Hipcamp works to support
                            those who care for the land and get more people out under the stars.
